The two use cases I can see are mostly \"Can't answer, doing something else, need fast reply\" or \"Can't answer, quiet environment, can take time to answer\".\n\n> Also, i think its appropriate to send message from that SIM only that\n> rejected the call \n> so that the caller would recognize who has sent message.\nI'd like UX to chime in on that one. Maybe the SIM card you received the call on is not the one you chose for SMS and so it would be expensive to send a SMS with that one. Also, if we're not gonna respect the user's preferred choice, we need to inform them before sending the message.\n\n> This feature is implemented so that the user can reply in quick to the\n> caller \n> in case of any urgency.So it is kept as a part of dialer.\n> Also if the caller hang up or goes to voice mail, the user can respond from\n> message App\n> or go to call log and send SMS.\nThinking about this use case (answer after call is over), I think we should implement this as a SMS activity.
